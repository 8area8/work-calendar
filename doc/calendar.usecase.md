# Calendar UseCase

## Calendar Modes

The calendar has two modes:

- a global mode if no search has been made in the selection bar. This mode allows you to view all employees every day.
- a filtered mode if an employee has been selected. This mode allows you to view the days worked by the employee and his working hours.

## User usage

- Going from month to month
- Going from year to year
- select an employee to get the second mode

## Admin usage

- Select a day to access the employee modification on that day

## The select bar

The select bar allows you to select an employee by name.
